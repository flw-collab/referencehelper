# Referencehelper

Helps you to comfortably insert successive references.

# Getting Started

For example: A reference like `25100-300`. The right end of the reference, e.g. `01`, will be continued in steps of 1. The new reference would be `25100-301` and so forth. The same is done for endings with letters, e.g. `25100a`.

# Hotkeys

<kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>: Copy highlighted reference.

<kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd>: Replaces the highlighted text or, if no text is selected, the first letter or digit before the mouse pointer with the next reference.

<kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd>: Resets the next reference by one step.

<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Esc</kbd>: Exit script.

### Installing and using
